## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up a webhook, you'll need:

1. **An HTTPS endpoint** - Your webhook receiver must use HTTPS (HTTP is not supported for security reasons)
2. **Workspace admin access** - Only workspace administrators can create, edit, and delete webhooks
3. **An eligible plan** - Upgrade to Plus or higher to access webhooks

### Creating a Webhook

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Click **Create Webhook**
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **URL**: Your HTTPS endpoint that will receive webhook events (e.g., `https://api.example.com/webhooks/jamie`)
   - **Description** (optional): A note to help you identify this webhook
   - **Events**: Select which events should trigger this webhook (currently only `meeting.completed`)
4. **Choose your authentication method:**

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="API Key (Recommended)">
       The simplest way to authenticate webhooks. Jamie will send a static API key in a header of your choice.
       - **Header Name**: Choose a custom header name (e.g., `x-jamie-api-key`, `x-make-apikey`, `Authorization`)
       - Leave empty to use the default `x-jamie-api-key`

       To verify requests, simply compare the header value with your stored secret. See [Security & Verification](/security-verification) for more implementation details.
     </Tab>
     <Tab title="Signature Verification (Advanced)">
       For maximum security, Jamie signs each request with HMAC-SHA256. This verifies both authenticity and payload integrity.

       The signature is sent in the `x-jamie-signature` header. See [Security & Verification](/security-verification) for implementation details.
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>
5. Click **Create**
6. **Save your secret key** - This is displayed only once. Store it securely (e.g., in your environment variables or secrets manager).

<Warning>
  Once you close the webhook creation dialog, you won't be able to see the secret key again. If you lose it, you'll need to regenerate it from the webhook settings.
</Warning>

## Events

Jamie currently supports the following webhook event:

### `meeting.completed`

Triggered when a meeting has been fully processed and is ready with:

- Meeting summary (in Markdown and HTML formats)
- Full transcript
- Extracted action items/tasks
- Participant information
- Meeting metadata

## Payload Structure

When a webhook event is triggered, Jamie sends a POST request to your endpoint with the following structure:

### Headers

Depending on your chosen authentication method, you'll receive different headers:

**API Key Authentication:**

```
Content-Type: application/json
user-agent: Jamie-Webhooks/1.0
x-jamie-api-key: sk_a1b2c3d4e5f6...  (or your custom header name)
jamie-event: meeting.completed
jamie-delivery: 7893456789012345678
```

**Signature Verification:**

```
Content-Type: application/json
user-agent: Jamie-Webhooks/1.0
x-jamie-signature: t=1234567890,v0=5f3d8a7b2c1e9f4a6b8c0d2e4f6a8b0c
jamie-event: meeting.completed
jamie-delivery: 7893456789012345678

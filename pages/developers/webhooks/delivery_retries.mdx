### Delivery Expectations

- **Timeout**: Webhook requests timeout after **30 seconds**
- **Success**: Your endpoint should return a 2xx HTTP status code to acknowledge receipt
- **Response Body**: The response body is not processed (you can return any content or leave it empty)

### Retry Behavior

If your endpoint doesn't respond with a 2xx status code, Jamie automatically retries the delivery with exponential backoff:

| Attempt | Delay      | Total Time Elapsed |
| :------ | :--------- | :----------------- |
| 1       | Immediate  | 0s                 |
| 2       | 10 seconds | 10s                |
| 3       | 60 seconds | 1m 10s             |
| 4       | 10 minutes | 11m 10s            |
| 5       | 1 hour     | 1h 11m 10s         |

After 5 failed attempts, the webhook delivery is marked as failed and:

- The webhook delivery is moved to a dead-letter queue
- Workspace administrators receive an email notification about the failure
- Email notifications are rate-limited to **1 per hour per webhook endpoint** to prevent spam

### Failure Scenarios

A webhook delivery fails and triggers a retry if:

- Your endpoint returns a non-2xx HTTP status code
- Your endpoint doesn't respond within 30 seconds
- A network error occurs during delivery

A webhook delivery is **skipped** (no retries) if:

- The webhook endpoint has been deleted
- The webhook endpoint is disabled/inactive

## Testing Webhooks

You can send a test webhook to verify your endpoint is working correctly:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Find the webhook you want to test
3. Click the **Test** button
4. Check your endpoint to confirm it received the test payload

Test webhooks:

- Send a realistic mock payload with sample meeting data
- Use the same retry and delivery mechanism as real webhooks
- Require the webhook to be **enabled/active**
- Count toward rate limits and retry attempts

<Tip>
  Use test webhooks during development to verify your signature verification and payload processing logic before going live.

### Webhook deliveries are failing

**Check your endpoint:**

- Ensure it's accessible from the internet (not localhost or behind a firewall)
- Verify it uses HTTPS (HTTP is not supported)
- Confirm it returns a 2xx status code
- Make sure it responds within 30 seconds

**Check your signature verification:**

- Ensure you're using the correct signing secret
- Verify you're comparing the raw request body (not parsed JSON)
- Check that timestamp validation isn't too strict (recommended: 5 minutes)

**Check the webhook status:**

- Ensure the webhook is enabled/active
- Verify you haven't exceeded the 5 webhooks per workspace limit

### Not receiving webhooks

**Verify the webhook configuration:**

- Check that the webhook is enabled/active
- Confirm the URL is correct
- Ensure you've selected the `meeting.completed` event

**Check your plan:**

- Webhooks require Plus, Pro, Team, or Enterprise plans
- Free plans don't have access to webhooks

**Verify meetings are completing:**

- Webhooks only fire when meetings are fully processed
- Check that meetings are being recorded and processed successfully

### Receiving duplicate webhooks

This is expected behavior and your endpoint should be **idempotent**:

- Use the `metadata.id` field to track which deliveries you've processed
- If you receive the same `metadata.id` twice, skip processing the duplicate

Duplicates can occur due to:

- Retries after temporary failures
- Network issues causing multiple delivery attempts

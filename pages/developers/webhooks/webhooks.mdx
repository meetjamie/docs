## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in Jamie. When a meeting is completed and processed, Jamie can automatically send the meeting data (summary, transcript, tasks, and more) to your specified endpoint.

This enables you to:

- **Integrate meeting data into your systems** - Automatically sync meeting summaries to your CRM, project management tools, or internal databases
- **Build custom workflows** - Trigger actions based on meeting completions, such as creating tickets, sending notifications, or updating records
- **Maintain data consistency** - Keep your systems up-to-date with the latest meeting information without manual exports

## Availability

Webhooks are available on the following plans:

- **Plus**
- **Pro**
- **Team**
- **Enterprise**

Each workspace can create up to **5 webhook endpoints**.

## Rate Limits

- **Maximum webhooks per workspace**: 5
- **Failure notification emails**: 1 per hour per webhook endpoint
- **Webhook timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Maximum retries**: 5 attempts

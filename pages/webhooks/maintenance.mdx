### Updating a Webhook

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Click the webhook you want to edit
3. Update the URL, description, or toggle the active status
4. Click **Save**

You can update:

- **URL**: Change where webhook events are delivered
- **Description**: Update the identifying note
- **Active Status**: Enable or disable webhook delivery without deleting the endpoint

<Info>
  You cannot update the selected events after creation. If you need different events, create a new webhook endpoint.
</Info>

### Regenerating the Signing Secret

If your signing secret is compromised or lost:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Click the webhook
3. Click **Regenerate Secret**
4. Save the new secret immediately - it will only be shown once
5. Update your webhook receiver with the new secret

<Warning>
  Regenerating the signing secret immediately invalidates the old one. Any webhooks using the old secret will fail verification. Update your receiving endpoint before regenerating.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Webhook

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Click the webhook you want to delete
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

Once deleted:

- The webhook stops receiving events immediately
- Any pending deliveries for this webhook are cancelled
- The signing secret is permanently invalidated
- This action cannot be undone

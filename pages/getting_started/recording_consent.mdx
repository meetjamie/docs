When using Jamie to take notes in your meetings, it's important to ensure all attendees are aware that the meeting is being recorded.

## Informing Attendees

There are two ways to let attendees know you'll be using Jamie:

### 1. Manual Announcement

At the beginning of your meeting, simply let attendees know that you'll be using Jamie to take notes. A quick statement like:

> "Just a heads up, I'll be using Jamie to take notes during this meeting."

### 2. Automated Recording Notice

Jamie can automatically send an email notification to your meeting attendees 24 hours before the meeting starts. This email informs them that you plan to use Jamie for note-taking.

**Requirements:**

- You must have your calendar connected to Jamie

**How it works:**

- Jamie checks your connected calendar for upcoming meetings
- 24 hours before each meeting, attendees receive an email notification
- The email explains that you'll be using Jamie and briefly describes what Jamie does
- Attendees from your workspace are automatically excluded (they already know about Jamie)

**How to enable:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Find the **Recording notice** toggle
3. Enable the toggle to start sending automatic notifications

## Respecting Attendee Preferences

**Recording consent is required.** If any attendee does not consent to the meeting being recorded, you must respect their wishes and not use Jamie for that meeting. It is your responsibility to ensure you have appropriate consent from all participants before recording.

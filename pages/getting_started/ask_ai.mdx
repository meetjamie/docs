![Tag Filter](/images/tag-filter.png)

Ask AI works in 3 different ways depending on your location in the app:

- **Meetings list: **When being in the general meetings list, Ask AI will search through all meetings.
- **Single Meeting: **Within a meeting, Ask AI will only query the current summary and transcript.
- **Tags: **When being in a tag, Ask AI only considers the tagged meetings.

## Chat with meeting

In this mode, the conversation will be restricted to the current meeting.

Jamie users find **Chat with Meeting** very helpful for making sure all the follow ups they need to perform are done fast and accurately.

## Chat with multiple meetings

If you are in any other page than an individual meeting, the AI will search relevant meetings for each response.

Jamie's AI will also send you the meetings that it used to formulate the response to your question.

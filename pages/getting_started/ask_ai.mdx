To access Ask AI, click on the Ask AI widget on the bottom right hand side of your screen.

Ask AI works in 2 different ways depending on your location in the app, either searching for meetings, or chatting with the meeting you are currently on.

## Chat with meeting

In this mode, the conversation will be restricted to the current meeting.

Jamie users find **Chat with Meeting** very helpful for making sure all the follow ups they need to perform are done fast and accurately.

## Search meetings

If you are in any other page than an individual meeting, the AI will search relevant meetings for each response.

Jamie's AI will also send you the meetings that it used to formulate the response to your question.

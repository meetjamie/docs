As for many companies, your meetings probably include company-specific words or unique product names every single day.

With our Custom Words feature, you can teach Jamie those terms, so your summaries become even more accurate, leaving you with less editing to do after a summary has been generated.

### How to save custom words in jamie?

Adding custom words to your jamie account can be done in two ways:

1. At the end of your 

   **summary settings**

2. Directly while 

   **editing**

    your meeting notes with 

   **find & replace**

### 1. Summary Settings

Simply navigate to your summary settings and start adding your custom words at the end of the page.

Keep in mind, that Jamie only requires the correct spelling of those terms, thus there is no need to include a description of your custom words.

  **Note:** Teaching jamie your custom words will only affect your account, not all jamie users. So your unique product names are safe with jamie
</Note>

### 2. Find & Replace

To make the editing process of your meeting notes easier, we have introduced a feature called **find & replace**, which allows you to manually fix typos once and have jamie implement the change throughout your entire summary or transcript.

**How it works:**

1. Highlight the word you would like to make changes to

2. Select 

   **replace**

    in the tooltip menu

3. Enter the correct term spelling

4. Hit 

   **enter**

Once you have made a change to a word through the **replace** button, jamie will not only find and replace this term, but it also will **automatically add** this to your **custom words.** Thus, there is no need to go back to your settings to manually add these terms.

<Note>
  **Note:** Changes made via the **find & replace** feature only apply to the section for which you have made the change. For instance, if you fixed a typo in your summary, Jamie will find and replace the word within your summary. However, as of now, this does not automatically apply to the transcript as well.

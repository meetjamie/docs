Like your meeting notes? So why not share your meeting summaries and action items with other attendees, friends, and/or your colleagues, regardless of whether they are users of our platform or not?

### How can you share your notes with others?

There are many ways you can share your meeting notes with others.&#x20;

<Info>
  **Note:** Jamie will never send out meeting notes automatically. You are in full control of who will receive a meeting summary from you to avoid spamming people.

  <Accordion title="Share via email" defaultOpen={false} icon="envelope">
    We all have little time, so that's why sharing a summary should be quick and easy. In Jamie you can share your summary with the click of a button. You can either share it with:

    * Individual participants of a meeting

    * All participants

    * Other parties by simply adding their email

    The summary will be emailed to them directly.

      **Important:** The participants of the meeting will only show if you have connected your calendar with Jamie.

    <Info>
      **Note:** To create a URL for your meeting notes, you have to first switch the slide bar to the right. You will then be able to copy and share the URL with others.

      Any changes made to the meeting notes by yourself will also update the URL that you have previously shared with others.

  <Accordion title="Copy paste" defaultOpen={false} icon="copy">
    You can also simply copy-paste your summary, action items, and transcript into any document or knowledge hub of your liking.

    Simply select and copy and paste the text you want to share into any location of your liking. The formatting will be adapted.

While notes can be shared with others, **only you** have the right to edit these notes. Others have viewing rights only and cannot make changes to your meeting notes.

## FAQs

    Certainly, you can easily share specific outputs, such as your meeting summary, tasks, or decisions, by simply copy and pasting any text from the summary.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I deactivate public sharing link?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Creating a URL and sharing it with others does not mean that they can have unlimited access to your summary notes.

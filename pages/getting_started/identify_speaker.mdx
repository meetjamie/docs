To identify speakers in a meeting, Jamie uses a speaker identification process. After your meeting notes have been generated, you'll be asked to listen to an audio clip and identify the speakers who attended the meeting.

This information will then be used to include speaker names in both your meeting summary and your transcript.

You can change the name at any point.&#x20;

<Note>
  **Note:** Once a speaker is identified, Jamie will remember this information and automatically identify speakers in future meetings. There is no need to identify the same speaker more than once.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Why do I have more or less identified speakers than participants in the meeting?">
  In rare occasions, the number of speakers identified in Jamie can differ from the actual count of active participants. This is due to variating audio quality during meetings or fast speaker turns. Jamie might identify the same speaker as two different speakers, or miss a speaker. Reasons can be background noise, internet issues, or microphone issues. Just add the same name twice and Jamie will add it to the summary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if the audio clip does not play any sound?">
  If the audio clip does not play any sound, just don't enter any name. This can be because Jamie identifies loud background noise or other noises during the meeting. If it turns out that Jamie did assign a speaker to that voice, you can change it in the summary.

<Accordion title="Can I edit the speaker after the speaker identification is done?">

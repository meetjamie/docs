Jamie makes it easy to save and organize your meeting summaries and transcripts directly in your favorite tools.

You can automatically send your notes to **Notion**, **OneNote**, or **Google Docs**, keeping everything organized in the apps you already use.

Each integration only needs to be connected once, and from then on you can share meeting notes with just one click or enable automatic syncing. If you have automatic syncing enabled, Jamie automatically sends every meeting to the selected tool after completion.

If you prefer sending notes manually or want to re-sync a meeting, simply open the meeting you want to share, click on the \*\*Share \*\*button, and select the tool youâ€™d like to send it to.

## Notion

You can connect your Notion workspace with Jamie to store all meeting notes in a dedicated Notion database.

Each meeting gets created as new page with the content you selected to send over (summary and/or transcript)

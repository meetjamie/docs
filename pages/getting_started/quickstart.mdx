Jamie is the fastest and easiest way to summarize all your meetings (online & offline) and get actionable insights in seconds.

This quickstart guide will walk you through how to set up your account in Jamie and start summarizing your meetings.

## How to get started?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create your account" defaultOpen="false" icon="seedling">
    Everything in Jamie happens either in an individual account or a team workspace. This means, you can either join your team's existing workspace or create your own individual account.

    To create an account, download the app from https://www.meetjamie.ai/ and sign up with Google, Microsoft, or your email address. Please follow the onboarding process in the app.

    **How to start a recording?**

    <u>Mic-based reminder:</u> You will get a mic-based reminder when you join your next online meeting. Simply click 'Start Jamie' to start recording.

    Now you can fully focus on the meeting and Jamie takes care of the note-taking.

    **How to stop a recording?**

    Once a meeting is done, simply stop the recording by clicking on the recording icon on the left.

    />

    **Access Your Notes:** After you stopped the recording, Jamie will begin generating your notes.

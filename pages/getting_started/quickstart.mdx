Jamie is the fastest and easiest way to summarize all your meetings (online & offline) and get actionable insights in seconds.

This quickstart guide will walk you through how to set up your workspace in Jamie and start summarizing your meetings.

## How to get started?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create your workspace" defaultOpen={false} icon="seedling">
    Everything in Jamie happens in a workspace. You can either join your team's existing workspace or create your own.&#x20;

    To create a workspace for you or your team, sign up atÂ [https://app.meetjamie.ai](https://app.meetjamie.ai)Â and sing up with Google or your email address. Please follow the onboarding process in your browser.

    <Info>
      **Please note:** If you are part of a shared workspace, you can store your meeting notes either in a private folder or share them with others in your team.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Download Recorder" defaultOpen={false} icon="download">
    Since Jamie does not need a virtual meeting bot to join the call, but works seamlessly in the background, we capture your system audio to record participants across any online meeting platform you want to use.&#x20;

    In order to use Jamie you need to download the app.&#x20;

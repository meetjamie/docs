Jamie's recorder captures your meetings and automatically generates summaries, transcripts, and action items. This guide explains how to use the recorder from start to finish.

## Starting a Recording

There are several ways to start recording a meeting with Jamie:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic Detection" defaultOpen="true" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    When Jamie detects that you've joined a video call (e.g. Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.), a notification will appear asking if you'd like to start recording.

    <img
      src="/images/mic-based-reminder.png"
      alt="Mic-based reminder notification"
      title="Mic-based reminder notification"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"68%" }}
    />

    Simply click **Start Jamie** to begin recording.

    <Info>
      You can customize which apps trigger automatic detection in your**Notifications**  settings, or disable this feature entirely.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manual Start from Menu Bar" defaultOpen="true" icon="bars">
    You can start a recording at any time from the menu bar (Mac) or system tray (Windows):

    1. Click on Jamie in your menu bar or system tray
    2. Select **Start Recording**

    {/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the menu bar/system tray menu showing Start Recording option */}

    <img
      src="/images/start_meeting_manually.png"
      alt="Start recording from menu bar"
      title="Start recording from menu bar"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"52%" }}
    />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Before starting, make sure your preferred microphone is connected. Jamie will use your default microphone automatically.
</Tip>

## During the Recording

Once you start recording, Jamie provides several features to help you during your meeting.

### The Recorder Widget

When recording, a compact floating widget appears on your screen. You can drag it anywhere to reposition it.

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the compact recorder widget */}

<img
  src="/images/recorder.png"
  alt="Compact recorder widget"
  title="Compact recorder widget"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"32%" }}
/>

Click on the widget to expand it and access the full meeting view.

### The Meeting View

The expanded meeting view gives you access to all features during your recording.

<img
  src="/images/scratchpad.png"
  alt="Scratchpad"
  title="Scratchpad"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"51%" }}
/>

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the expanded meeting view showing the full interface */}

### Changing Your Microphone

Need to switch microphones mid-meeting? Click the **microphone icon** in the recorder controls to open the microphone selector dropdown and choose a different microphone.

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the microphone dropdown open */}

<img
  src="/images/change_mic.png"
  alt="Change Mic"
  title="Change Mic"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"60%" }}
/>

Your audio source will switch seamlessly without interrupting the recording.

### Using the Scratchpad

During a live meeting, the **Scratchpad** tab is selected by default. Use it to write private notes - perfect for jotting down quick thoughts, noting important points to follow up on, or writing reminders for yourself. Those notes will not be incorporated in the summary created by Jamie but are standalone.

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the scratchpad tab with some example notes */}

<Info>
  Your scratchpad notes are **private by default** and won't be included when you share the meeting summary with others.
</Info>

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the live transcript tab showing real-time transcription */}

## Stopping the Recording

When your meeting ends, stop the recording directly from the recorder widget or, if you have the recorder expanded to the full meeting view, from the bottom recorder bar where you will find a red **Stop **button.

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot highlighting the stop button in the recorder controls */}

<Warning>
  If you stop a recording that's less than 5 minutes long, Jamie will show a warning. Very short recordings may not generate useful summaries. You can choose to stop anyway or continue recording.
</Warning>

### If You Close Jamie

If you accidentally close Jamie during a recording, don't worry - Jamie will ask for confirmation before stopping. If you quit Jamie, the current recording will be saved.

## After the Recording

Once you stop recording, Jamie immediately begins processing your meeting.

### Processing Steps

Jamie processes your meeting in the following order:

<img
  src="/images/SummaryCard.png"
  alt="Summary Card"
  title="Summary Card"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"72%" }}
/>

{/* TODO: Insert screenshot of the processing progress view */}

1. **Transcribing** — Converting the audio to text
2. **Speaker Matching** — Identifying who said what (if Speaker Memory is enabled)
3. **Writing Summary** — Creating your meeting notes
4. **Creating Tasks** — Extracting action items

### Expected Wait Times

Processing typically takes about **5 minutes** total, though this can vary based on meeting length.

### What You'll Get

When processing completes, you'll have access to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Summary" icon="pen-to-square">
    AI-generated meeting notes in a structured format
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transcript" icon="text">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Scratchpad" icon="note-sticky">

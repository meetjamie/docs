## What are templates?

Templates let you control both the structure and the content of your meeting summaries.

You define the sections and what should go into each one. That way, your summaries come out ready to use, with exactly the sections and details you need.

## When you'd use it

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team alignment" icon="users">
    You want every summary to look the same across the team so updates, decisions, and next steps are always easy to find.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Different meeting types" icon="calendar">
    Standups, 1:1s, client calls, retros. Each gets its own format so people can skim for exactly what they care about.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repeatable sales & CS calls" icon="handshake">
    Every call captures pain points, objections, and next steps in the same structure-making follow-ups and handoffs effortless.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Less time fixing notes" icon="clock">
    Instead of reformatting notes after every call, templates give you publish-ready summaries in one click.
  </Card>

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sales team lead">
    You create a template for sales calls with sections for "Customer Pain Points," "Budget Discussion," and "Next Steps." Now every sales call summary comes ready for your CRM.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product manager">
    You duplicate the default template and add a "Feature Requests" section with instructions to pull out any product suggestions mentioned. You use this for all customer feedback calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team manager">
    You make separate templates for your weekly team syncs and your one-on-one meetings. The team sync template focuses on project updates and blockers. The one-on-one template focuses on personal goals and feedback.

</AccordionGroup>

## Tips and common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple templates on the same meeting?">
    You can switch templates as many times as you like. Each time you apply a different template, Jamie regenerates the summary in that new format.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will applying a template change my transcript?">
    No. Templates only change how the summary is formatted. Your original transcript stays the same.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit the templates provided by Jamie?">
    To customize a Jamie created template, use the **Duplicate** button to make your own copy, then edit that.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who can see my personal templates?">
    Personal templates are private to your account. Only you can see and use them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a template I've used before?">
    Meetings that used that template keep their existing summaries. You just won't be able to apply that template to new meetings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I write good section instructions?">
    Be specific about what you want. For example, instead of "Action items," try "List all tasks mentioned with who is responsible and any deadlines discussed."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limits and things to keep in mind

<Warning>
  Each template needs at least one section with a title and instructions to work properly.
</Warning>

- When you apply a template, it may take a few moments for Jamie to generate the new summary.
- Very long or complex templates may take longer to process.
- Templates work best when the meeting transcript has enough content for each section. If the meeting didn't cover a topic, that section may be brief or empty.
- You can only delete templates you created yourself.

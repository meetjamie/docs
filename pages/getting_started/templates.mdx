## What this feature does

Templates let you control how your meeting summaries look and what information they include. Instead of getting the same default format every time, you can choose or create templates that match how you work. This means you get summaries that are ready to use right away, with the sections and details you actually need.

## When you'd use it

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Different meeting types" icon="calendar">
    You run team syncs, one-on-ones, and client calls—and want a different format for each.

    You want every sales call summary to include action items and next steps.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sales team lead">
    You create a template for sales calls with sections for "Customer Pain Points," "Budget Discussion," and "Next Steps." Now every sales call summary comes ready for your CRM.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product manager">
    You duplicate the default template and add a "Feature Requests" section with instructions to pull out any product suggestions mentioned. You use this for all customer feedback calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team manager">
    You make separate templates for your weekly team syncs and your one-on-one meetings. The team sync template focuses on project updates and blockers. The one-on-one template focuses on personal goals and feedback.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips and common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple templates on the same meeting?">
    You can switch templates as many times as you like. Each time you apply a different template, Jamie regenerates the summary in that new format.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will applying a template change my transcript?">
    No. Templates only change how the summary is formatted. Your original transcript stays the same.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit the default templates?">
    Default templates are read-only. To customize one, use the **Duplicate** button to make your own copy, then edit that.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who can see my personal templates?">
    Personal templates are private to your account. Only you can see and use them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a template I've used before?">
    Meetings that used that template keep their existing summaries. You just won't be able to apply that template to new meetings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I write good section instructions?">
    Be specific about what you want. For example, instead of "Action items," try "List all tasks mentioned with who is responsible and any deadlines discussed."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limits and things to keep in mind

<Warning>
Each template needs at least one section with a title and instructions to work properly.
</Warning>

- When you apply a template, it may take a few moments for Jamie to generate the new summary.
- Very long or complex templates may take longer to process.
- Templates work best when the meeting transcript has enough content for each section. If the meeting didn't cover a topic, that section may be brief or empty.
- You can only delete templates you created yourself.

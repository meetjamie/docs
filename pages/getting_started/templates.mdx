## What are templates?

Templates let you control the structure and content of your meeting summaries. You decide which sections to include and what belongs in each one, so your summaries come out ready to use with the details you care about.

## When you'd use a template

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team alignment" icon="users">
    You want every summary to look the same across the team so updates, decisions, and next steps are always easy to find.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Different meeting types" icon="calendar">
    Standups, 1:1s, client calls, retros. Each gets its own format so people can skim for exactly what they care about.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repeatable sales & CS calls" icon="handshake">
    Every call captures pain points, objections, and next steps in the same structure-making follow-ups and handoffs effortless.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Less time fixing notes" icon="clock">
    Instead of reformatting notes after every call, templates give you publish-ready summaries in one click.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips and common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I write good section instructions?">
    Be specific about what you want, both in terms of content and formatting. For example, an interview template with a section titled "Work Experience" could say: "List the candidate’s experience in chronological order, including their title, the company name, and how long they spent there."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple templates on the same meeting?">
    You can switch templates as many times as you like. Each time you apply a different template, Jamie regenerates the summary in that new format.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will applying a template change my transcript?">
    No. Templates only change how the summary is formatted. Your original transcript stays the same.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit the templates provided by Jamie?">
    To customize a Jamie created template, use the **Duplicate** button to make your own copy, then edit that.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who can see my templates?">
    Personal templates are private to your account. Only you can see and use them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a template I've used before?">
    Meetings that used that template keep their existing summaries. You just won't be able to apply that template to new meetings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Things to keep in mind

<Warning>
  Each template needs at least one section with a title and instructions to work properly. Sections with a missing title or instructions will be ignored.
</Warning>

- When you apply a template, it may take a few moments for Jamie to generate the new summary. Very long templates or meetings may take longer to process.
- Templates work best when the meeting transcript has enough content for each section. If the meeting didn't cover a topic, that section may be brief or empty.
- If you close Jamie or click away while a template is applying, it stops and your notes return to how they were.

With our tag feature, you can categorize your meeting notes, helping you to filter your notes based on projects, clients, and more.

Tags are keywords that you can attach to different meeting notes to easily classify and categorize them. Since they are fully customizable, you can create labels from any kind of words or numbers.

To add a tag to a meeting, just open the meeting summary and click on 🏷️ **Add tag** in the meeting header. A meeting can have multiple tags.

Tags can be:

- Projects
- Clients
- Departments
- Teams
- Jobs to be done
- etc.

### How to create tags?

To create a tag in Jamie, head to the left sidebar, click **\+ New tag**. This will open a popup where you can:

1. Choose between **Private** (only visible to you) or **Shared** (visible to selected teammates)
2. Select teammates to share with (for shared tags)
3. Pick a color for your tag
4. Enter your tag name

You can also quickly create a tag while adding one to a meeting - just type a name that doesn't exist yet and select "Create".

### Private vs Shared tags

**Private tags** are only visible to you. Use them for personal organization.

**Shared tags** allow you to share specific meetings with teammates without sharing your entire meeting library. When you add a meeting to a shared tag, all contributors of that tag can view that meeting.

<Note>
  Shared tags are available on Team and Enterprise plans.
</Note>

#### How shared tags work

- **As the owner**: You create the tag and choose which teammates to share it with. Only you can add or remove members.
- **As a contributor**: You can view all meetings in the shared tag and add your own meetings.

Shared tags are marked with a small users icon in the sidebar and throughout the app.

### How to manage tag sharing?

To add or remove contributors from a shared tag:

1. Click on the three dots of a tag in the sidebar
2. Select **Edit** or **Share**
3. Add or remove teammates from the sharing list

To stop sharing a tag entirely, remove all contributors - it will become a private tag. Alternatively, you can just change the type to **Private**, which will automatically remove all contributors.

### How to filter by tags?

To filter your meetings by a specific tag, just click the tag in the sidebar and only meetings that have that tag will be displayed.

### How to leave a shared tag?

If you're a contributor to a shared tag and no longer want access:

1. Click on the three dots of the tag in the sidebar
2. Select **Remove**

You will no longer see the tag or its meetings.

The time that Jamie needs to generate a summary, depends on multiple factors. Such as audio quality, language, length of the meeting, and more.

Usually, Jamie takes between 1–5 minutes to generate your meeting notes after you have stopped the audio recording.

If **after 2–4 hours,** your summary still seems to be stuck in the generation progress, please contact us at [**support@meetjamie.ai**](mailto:support@meetjamie.ai) or report the issue via the feedback box on the left sidebar of your jamie application.

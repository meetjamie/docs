For every meeting recorded with Jamie, one credit is charged, regardless of the duration of the meeting. However, for meetings shorter than 5 minutes, no credit is charged.

Jamie has several plans to fit different needs, from individuals just starting out, to large teams with more meetings.

Once you have used all your credits in Jamie, your meeting notes will be locked, and you will need to upgrade to a paid plan to access them. This can either be because you've reached the maximum credits or exceeded the allowed duration limit of your free or paid plan.

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when you go over the limit?" defaultOpen="false">
    Once you go over the meeting credit limit or extend the duration limit, your summary will be locked. But don’t worry\! Once you approach your credit limit or meeting duration limit, Jamie will remind you.

    This gives you the chance to stop the meeting if you don’t want to upgrade.

    To unlock any meeting summaries for meetings that went over time or credit limit, simply upgrade to one of the higher tier plans.

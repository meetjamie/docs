Do you want to create even better summaries with Jamie? Custom templates can be an effective way to do so, as they enable you to customize your meeting summaries to your needs.

By creating and applying custom templates you can indicate to jamie what your summary should include and how to structure it.

3. Create your custom template from scratch
4. Add your preferred title, section titles, and descriptions
5. Click **Create**

**Tip:** Think of the **description** as a custom prompt for Jamie, meaning that you should include any details that you would want to see in the summary. Just imagine, jamie is your assistant that needs to know what should be noted down and what to leave out.

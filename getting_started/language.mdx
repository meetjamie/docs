**By default**, Jamie automatically detects the language that is spoken during the meeting and generates the summary, action items, and the transcript in that language.

However, in some use cases, this might not be what you want and need.

Let's say some of your meetings are in French 🇫🇷, but your company language has recently changed to English 🇬🇧. In that case, Jamie can directly generate your meeting summary in English 🇬🇧, although the meeting was in French 🇫🇷.

<Note>
**Note:** Keep in mind, that your language can only be set before a meeting. You cannot change the language of your summary output once jamie has generated your notes.

### How to set up your output language in Jamie

The language of your meeting notes can be set and/or changed in your settings. Simply head to your summary settings and select the language that you prefer for your meeting summary.

<Note>
**Important:** selecting your language in the settings will force the summary output to be in that language, meaning both action items and the summary, will be in that language. 

However, this does not change the language of your transcript, which will always be generated in the language of the meeting.

### Best Practices:
<Accordion title="You only speak one language in meetings and within your company?">
    Then change the language settings to your company and meeting language, e.g. English 🇬🇧.  

</Accordion>

<Accordion title=" You have a company language, but some meetings are in a different language?">
    Then change the language settings to your company language, e.g. English 🇬🇧, which will ensure that your meeting notes are automatically translated by Jamie.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You speak multiple languages and always want the summary output to be generated in the language of the meeting?">
    Select the default language setting "automatically detected" in your summary settings. This will ensure that all output, meaning action points, the summary, and the transcript, is generated in the language of your meeting.

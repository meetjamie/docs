Copy Paste works out of the box in Jamie, using ctrl \+ c / ctrl \+ v, or cmd \+ c / cmd \+ v on a Mac.

You can copy paste content from, and to Jamie meeting summaries.

You can also use the "Copy" button on tasks to copy them over.

Notion will preserve the formatting of the summary that you can see in the Jamie app.

### [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/)

Todoist will autodetect multiple tasks and split the content you are pasting.

<Info>
  Todoist does not currently autodetect task completion. You will need to mark tasks complete yourself.

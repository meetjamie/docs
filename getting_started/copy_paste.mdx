Copy Paste works out of the box in Jamie, using ctrl \+ c / ctrl \+ v, or cmd \+ c / cmd \+ v on a Mac.

You can copy paste content from, and to Jamie meeting summaries.

You can also use the "Copy" button on tasks to copy them over.

### [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/)

## [Bear](https://bear.app/)

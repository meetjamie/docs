## How Integrations Work

### Connecting an Integration

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Select the integration you want to connect
3. Click **Connect** and follow the authorization flow
4. Configure your preferences

### Sharing to Integrations

Once connected, you can share meetings to integrations in two ways:

- **Manual sharing** — Click **Share** on any meeting, go to the **Integrations** tab, and select where to send it
- **Automatic sync** — Enable auto-sync in integration settings to automatically send all new meetings

### Managing Integrations

You can manage your integrations at any time in **Settings → Integrations**:

- **View connection status** — See which integrations are connected
- **Configure settings** — Choose what content to sync (summary, transcript, tasks)
- **Disconnect** — Remove an integration when you no longer need it

## What Gets Synced

Each integration lets you choose what content to include:

| Content        | Description                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**    | AI-generated meeting notes              |
| **Transcript** | Full word-for-word transcript           |
| **Tasks**      | Action items extracted from the meeting |

<Info>
  Not all integrations support all content types. Check individual integration pages for details.

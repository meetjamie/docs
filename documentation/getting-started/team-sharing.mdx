Jamie makes it easy to share meetings with your team. Whether you want to send a quick summary via email, share the full meeting with workspace members, or create a public link, Jamie has you covered.

<Info>
  Team sharing features are available on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans. Email sharing and link sharing are available on all plans.

## Sharing Options

Jamie offers multiple ways to share your meetings:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Email" icon="envelope">
    Send summaries directly to anyone's inbox
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team" icon="users">
    Share full meetings with workspace members
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link" icon="link">
    Create a public link anyone can view
  </Card>
</Columns>

To share a meeting, click the **Share** button in the meeting header.

## Email Sharing

Share your meeting summary via email with anyone, even if they don't have a Jamie account.

### How It Works

1. Click **Share** on any meeting
2. Enter an email address and click **Send**
3. The recipient receives the summary in their inbox

Meeting participants are automatically shown for quick sharing. You can send to individual participants or use **Send to all** to share with everyone at once.

<Warning>
  Email sharing only includes the **summary**. The transcript and tasks are not included. For full meeting access, use Team sharing or the public link instead.
</Warning>

## Team Sharing

Share complete meetings with members of your Jamie workspace. This is the best option when you want colleagues to have full access to all meeting content within Jamie.

<Info>
  Team sharing requires a **Team** or **Enterprise** plan. [Upgrade your plan](/pages/settings/billing) to unlock this feature.
</Info>

### How It Works

1. Click **Share** on any meeting
2. Go to the **Team** tab
3. Search for a teammate by name or email
4. Click on their name to share

Participants who were in the meeting are shown first, making it easy to share notes with attendees.

### Viewing Shared Meetings

Meetings shared with you appear in the **Shared with me** section, accessible from the main navigation.

![Shared With Me](/images/shared-with-me.png)

You can:

- **Filter by person** — See only meetings from a specific teammate
- **Filter by date** — Jump to meetings from a specific time period
- **View any shared meeting** — Click to see the full summary, transcript, and tasks

Each meeting shows who shared it with you, so you always know the source.

### Managing Access

**As the meeting owner, you can:**

- **Revoke access** — Click on a shared teammate and select "Revoke access" to remove their access

**As a recipient, you can:**

- **Remove from your list** — Remove a shared meeting from your "Shared with me" section (this doesn't affect others' access)

## Link Sharing

Create a public link that anyone can use to view your meeting.

![Email Sharing](/images/email-sharing.png)

### How It Works

1. Click **Share** on any meeting
2. In the **Email** tab, find the **Link sharing** section at the very bottom
3. Toggle the switch to make the link **live**
4. Click **Copy link** to copy it to your clipboard

<Warning>
  When the link is live, **anyone with the link can view the meeting**. Make sure you only share links with intended recipients.
</Warning>

### What Link Viewers See

People viewing via a shared link see a read-only version of your meeting with:

- Meeting title and metadata
- Summary content
- Transcript content

They can copy content but cannot edit anything.

### Disabling a Link

To revoke access via a shared link, simply toggle the link switch off. The link will immediately stop working for anyone who has it.

## Notifications

Control how you're notified about shared meetings in [Notifications](/pages/getting_started/notifications).

- **Team sharing emails** — Get notified when a teammate shares a meeting with you (Team/Enterprise only)

## Integration Sharing

You can also send your meeting content to external tools like Notion, Google Docs, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more. Learn how to set up and use integrations in [Integrations](/pages/getting_started/integrations).

### Summary Ready

When enabled, you'll receive an email as soon as Jamie finishes processing your meeting. This is helpful if you step away after a meeting and want to be notified when your notes are ready.

### Email Updates

Receive occasional updates from Jamie about new features, improvements, and tips to get more out of your meetings.

### Team Sharing

<Info>
  This option is only available on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.
</Info>

Get notified via email when a teammate shares a meeting with you. This ensures you never miss important meeting notes that have been shared with you.

### Recording Notice

When enabled, Jamie will automatically send an email to your meeting attendees letting them know the meeting will be recorded. This helps with transparency and consent.

<Warning>
  Recording notice requires a connected calendar (Google Calendar or Outlook). Connect your calendar in **Settings → Integrations** to enable this feature.
</Warning>

Learn more about recording consent in our [Recording Consent](/pages/getting_started/recording_consent) guide.

## App Notifications

App notifications are available in the Jamie desktop app and help you start recording meetings quickly.

<Info>
  App notification settings can only be adjusted in the **Jamie desktop app**. If you're viewing this in your browser, open the Jamie app to configure these settings.
</Info>

### Auto-Detected Meetings

When enabled, Jamie will monitor your system for active calls and show a "Start Jamie" reminder when a meeting is detected. This ensures you never forget to record an important meeting.

When you start a call in apps like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or other video conferencing tools, Jamie will prompt you to start recording.

### App Filtering

If you have auto-detected meetings enabled, you can customize which apps trigger notifications. This is useful if you want to:

- Disable notifications for casual video calls
- Only get reminders for specific meeting apps
- Avoid notifications during personal calls

To filter apps:

1. Enable **Auto-detected meetings**
2. Click **Select an app** to add apps to your exclusion list
3. Selected apps will no longer trigger "Start Jamie" reminders

You can remove apps from the exclusion list at any time by clicking the **X** next to the app name.

Jamie has several plans to fit different needs, from individuals just starting out, to large teams with more meetings. [Here’s you can see an overview](https://www.meetjamie.ai/pricing).

Once you have used all your credits in Jamie, your meeting notes will be locked, and you will need to upgrade to a paid plan to access them. This can be either because you reached the maximum credits of your free or paid plan.

If you want to continue using Jamie, please upgrade to a larger plan or wait until your plan is renewed.

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when you go over the limit?" defaultOpen="false">
    Once you go over the meeting credit limit or extend the duration limit, your summary will be locked. But don’t worry\! Once you approach your credit limit or meeting duration limit, Jamie will remind you.

    This gives you the chance to stop the meeting if you don’t want to upgrade.

    To unlock any meeting summaries for meetings that went over time, simply upgrade to one of the paid plans.

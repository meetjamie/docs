### FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens with your data, and where is it being stored?" defaultOpen={false}>
    The audio recording from your computer is uploaded to a server location in Frankfurt, Germany 🇩🇪 and then processed on a serverless GPU environment from [Modal](https://modal.com/) (no data is stored at Modal). Once the processing is done and your transcript is ready, we **delete all audio files permanently.**



    The transcript of a meeting is stored on a server located in Frankfurt, Germany 🇩🇪 to make it accessible to users.



    After the generation of your transcript, it is further processed via an [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API to generate your meeting notes.

    Our sole purpose in training Jamie is to enhance your user experience, particularly in the domains of [speaker identification](https://intercom.help/meetjamie/en/articles/7913795-how-to-identify-speakers-in-jamie) and recognizing [custom words](https://intercom.help/meetjamie/en/articles/8182580-how-to-use-and-add-custom-words-in-jamie).
